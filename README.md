Liquid Engine - Accelerating Bioimage Analysis with dynamic selection of algorithm variations

---

Liquid Engine

The Liquid Engine is a high-performance, adaptive framework designed to optimize computational workflows for bioimage analysis. It dynamically generates optimized CPU and GPU-based code variations and selects the fastest combination based on input parameters and device performance, significantly enhancing computational speed. The Liquid Engine employs a machine learning-based Agent to predict the optimal combination of implementations, adaptively responding to delays and performance variations.

Key features include:

    - Multiple Implementations: Utilizes various acceleration strategies such as PyOpenCL, CUDA, Cython, Numba, Transonic, and Dask to deliver optimal performance.
    - Machine Learning Agent: Predicts the best-performing implementation combinations and adapts dynamically to ensure maximum efficiency.
    - Automatic Benchmarking: Continuously benchmarks different implementations to maintain a historical record of runtimes and improve performance over time.
    - Seamless Integration: Can easily be integrated into any existing workflow with no extra work for end users.

The Liquid Engine's adaptability and optimization capabilities make it a powerful tool for researchers handling extensive microscopy datasets and requiring high computational efficiency.
